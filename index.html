						- Games are the first WebGL example that comes to mind,

						- In medicine you can make interactive 3D models of the internal organs of living beings with the help of WebGL.
						- In E-commerce 3D graphics have a multitude of uses, ranging from simple product presentations, 
						to product customization and realistic previews of different materials.
						- Artwork - this may be one of the most important applications of WebGL in general - the creativity of artists 
						and illustrators across the globe combined with the power and freedom that WebGL provides.

				<section>How it works?
					<aside class="notes">To understand how WebGL works it helps to first understand basic 3D theory and the rendering pipeline.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>3D scene:</p>
					<img src="./assets/3d-2.png" alt="" style="width: 600px;">
					<aside class="notes">In fact, all WebGL can do is draw triangles. But it can draw them very quickly and in large numbers. 
						If you want a square, connect two triangles. You want a line? OK, it's just a few triangles connected in series.
						In a 3D scene every point is a vertex identified by an X, Y and Z coordinates.</aside>
				</section>
					
				<section>
					<p>3D scene render:</p>
					<img src="./assets/3d-3.png" alt="" style="width: 800px;">
					<aside class="notes">The vertices are then connected together to form a bunch of little triangles, known as primitives</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>3D scene render:</p>
					<img src="./assets/3d-4.png" alt="" style="width: 800px;">
					<aside class="notes">Then a light source bounces off of them to create the appearance of shadows and depth perception. They are then rasterized to convert a 3D vector graphic into a projection of a 2D pixel, 
						which tricks our brains into seeing a 3D object on a two-dimensional computer screen.</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>3D scene shading:</p>
					<img src="./assets/3d-5.png" alt="" style="width: 800px;">
					<aside class="notes">This pipeline can be customized by writing shaders, 
						which are just functions that tells a computer how to draw pixels on the screen.
						Shading requires the computer to perform a ton of linear algebra or matrix multiplication to render graphics smoothly at 60fps.
						It's often too much for the CPU to handle by itself which is why we have GPUs to distribute the calculations more efficiently.
						WebGL allows us to process graphics on a GPU and it's based on a library that's been around since 1992 called OpenGL.

					<p>Start drawing:</p>
					<pre data-id="code"><code data-line-numbers class="hljs" data-trim>
						const canvas = document.querySelector("#myCanvas");
						const gl = canvas.getContext("webGl");
						</code></pre>
						<aside class="notes">To get started you just need to grab an HTML canvas in the DOM and then get it's WebGL context to start drawing.
						</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>JS control code:</p>
					<pre data-id="code"><code data-line-numbers class="hljs" data-trim>
						function drawIn3d() {
							webGlUtils.resizeCanvasToDisplaySize(gl.canvas);

							const primitive = gl.TRIANGLES;

							gl.drawArrays(primitive, 0, 5);
						}
						</code></pre>
						<aside class="notes">The main program code is written in JavaScript, but shaders are written in the OpenGL ES-shading language.
						</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>OpenGL shaders:</p>
					<img src="./assets/3d-4.png" alt="" style="width: 800px;">
					<pre data-id="code"><code data-line-numbers class="hljs" data-trim>
						attribute vec2 a_position;

						uniform vec2 u_resolution;
						uniform vec2 u_translation;

						void main() {
							vec2 position = a_position + u_translation;
							vec2 zeroToOne = position | u_resolution;
						}
						</code></pre>
						<aside class="notes">A Shader will take information about a vertex or fragment 
							and use the GPU to calculate the data required to render it as a pixel on the screen.

					<p>This looks hard...</p>
					<img src="./assets/hard.png" alt="">
					<aside class="notes">Luckily you don't need to write shaders by hand. To start adding 3D graphics to 
						your website you can use libraries like Three.js or tools like Spline.Design to quickly design 3D experiences without
						 much underlying knowledge of WebGL.

					Why is WebGL used?
					<section>
						<li>Performance - WebGL is extremely fast and takes full advantage of hardware acceleration</li>
						<aside class="notes">
							Given the abundance of graphical display technologies available such as CSS, Canvas, SVG and plugin-based solutions 
							like Silver Flight and Flash you may be wondering where WebGL fits in and whether you need to learn it, 
							so let have a look at some of the reasons why you should:
							Performance - WebGL is extremely fast and takes full advantage of hardware acceleration making it ideal for games and sophisticated visuals.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<li>Tasks - it can perform and render functions that other technologies can't or more precisely can't so well</li>
						<aside class="notes">
							Tasks - it can perform and render functions that other technologies can't or more precisely can't so well. 
							For example creating intricate lighting and reflecting material effects with SVG can be a real head scratcher but 
							it could be easily pulled off using WebGL.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<li>Shaders - to create complicated visual effects WebGL apps can use shaders.</li>
						<aside class="notes">
							Shaders - to create complicated visual effects WebGL apps can use shaders. 
							A basic Shader may represent water or flames while a more complicated version could provide difficult effects.

					Thanks for your attention!
					<aside class="notes">As you can see WebGL opens up a lot of doors for web developers, game designers, animators and visual artists. 
						When used in conjunction with HTML5 features you may construct powerful and professional web browser-based apps. So, Thanks for your attention!</aside>
